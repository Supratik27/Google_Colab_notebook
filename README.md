The IRIS data used in the example has a total of 150 data samples that comprise 50 from
each class of IRIS Setosa, IRIS Virginica, and IRIS Versicolor.
During the training and test split, 70% was used for training and 30% for testing purposes.
30% of 150 is 45. That’s the reason the total support count is 45.
For instance, depending on the output, among the 45, there can be 13 Iris Setosa, 14 Iris
Virginica, and 18 Iris Versicolor. The same number has been reflected during the
prediction evaluations in the confusion matrix

30% of 150 is 45. That’s the reason the total support count is 45.
For instance, depending on the output, among the 45, there can be 16 Iris Setosa, 15 Iris
